The following game is called 2048. It's a simple number game made in c++. There's a 4x4 board on which numbers spawn at random, and you have to move the board with the arrow keys, and add those numbers up!

But there are some rules:

1- Spawning numbers are 2's or 4's only.

2- The number will spawn at a random position if the given position is a zero.

3- You can only add up SIMILAR numbers, in the direction of the movement of the board.

4- Board can move in the left, right, upward, or downward direction. Your controls are the arrow keys.

5- When 2 tiles of the board add up, one of them is left with the value zero.

6- Try keeping the largest numbers in the corner :D





When the game starts player is welcomed by a message and a menu.
