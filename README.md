The following game is called 2048. It's a simple number game made in c++. There's a 4x4 board on which numbers spawn at random, and you have to move the board with the arrow keys, and add those numbers up!
But there are some rules:

Spawning numbers are 2's or 4's only.
The number will spawn at a random position if the given position is a zero.
You can only add up SIMILAR numbers, in the direction of the movement of the board.
Board can move in the left, right, upward, or downward direction. Your controls are the arrow keys.
When 2 tiles of the board add up, one of them is left with the value zero.
Try keeping the largest numbers in the corner :D
When the game starts player is welcomed by a message and a menu.

Play: Initiates the 2048 game
Instructions: Displays instructions and rules
Exit: Closes the game
A counter keeps track of your current game score (it resents every game), and another counter keeps track of your overall highest score! Try beating your highest score!!
